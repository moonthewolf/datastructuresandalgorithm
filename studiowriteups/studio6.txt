Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:
1. Find first if there are elements in Array A and Array B
2. Some value A min and B min
3. compare two elements, put lower value at C
4. A or B min which was extracted, set its value at original array to null. 

Question A2:
We convinced our TA Robert.

Question A3:
Yes. After the original value is replaced with null, the value of i or j can be set as i+1 or j+1

Question A4:
The loop will run as long as there are elements in array A and array B
The loop will add elements to Array C as long as the loop is running.
The array will be completed when there are no elements of value other than null in array A and B.
Therefore, Array C will contain (elements of A + elements of B) elements.
Question A5:
It's going to run until A and B is empty.
Loop will sort either of the two elements in order.

Question B1:
n

Question B2:
T(n) = 2(t(n/2)) + cn
Question B3:
BigTheta(nlogn)
Question B4:
k(t(n/k)) + cn
Question B5:
BigTheta(nlogn)
Question C1:
nlog(n)
Question C2:
Over-write the pre-existing arrays, so you would only need an array of size n, and two arrays n/2.
Question C3:
Because heapsort requires one heap, it wouldn't need two arrays like mergesort.
Requires less memory.
Question C4:
plug in elements of array A into the heap by using decreaser.
Question C5:
insert into the array n-1 to 0.
