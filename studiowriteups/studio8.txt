Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:
Output returns internal values of the points and not the hashcode.
Question A2:
IF the Contents of the points are equal, they should also have 
equal hash code value.
Question A3:
int c = (x * 1234) + (y*1234);
Question A4:
No, because (2,0) and (1,1) would give the same answer.
Question A5:
return 0
no, because all values will have the same hash code.
Question B1:
32 bits. Each integer takes 8 bits.
Question B2:
Yes, 32 bit integer gives all possible permutations.
It would be possible that two distinct color has the same hash code.
Doesn't mean they are of the same value.
Question B3:
Yes. Difference is about 40.
Basically the same when the power of modulus increases.
Question B4:
32: about 40
64: about 60
128: about 40
256: about 40
The deviation isn't greatly important?
Question C1:
The hisogram is left skewed.
Question C2:
The histogram is more normally distributed. 
Not really.
Question C3:
There are more variations. 
The difference in runtime between buckets will vary.
Affects Worst/ Best case scenario.
Question D1:
It depends on how large 2^k is?
Modulus value can be clustered, potentially diminishing uniformity.
Question D2:
YEs.
Question D3:

Question D4:

Question D5:

Question D6:
